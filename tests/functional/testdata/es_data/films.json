    "description": "A combination of an interactive 3D movie and a stage performance, Borg Invasion 4D was a Star Trek: Voyager-based attraction, part of the Star Trek: The Experience series of attractions at the Las Vegas Hilton in Paradise, Nevada. Borg Invasion 4D ran from 2004 to 2008. The audience enters a small theater where physically present actors portraying the Star Fleet crew greet them. The story is told through prerecorded 3D film sequences and actors' interaction with them and the audience. The story takes place some time after the end of the ST: Voyager series. The audience takes the roll of guests on a secret space station where Doctor from Voyager works with researches on creating a new DNA strain that will be resistant to the Borg's assimilation techniques. The guests are there to have themselves tested and help the research in case their DNA contains the resistant strain. Then the Borg attack. Actors lead the audience through a couple of hallways as other actors dressed as the Borg assimilate the researchers. Finally, the audience and the \"surviving\" actors reach another small theater that represents an escape shuttle and there a new series of prerecorded 3D film sequences starts. The shuttle launches but the Borg cube with the Queen inside captures it. As the Queen taunts the audience, the Borg are tearing the shuttle apart. Just as they are about to reach the audience, a familiar, charmingly raspy, friendly female voice is heard as well as the sound of proton torpedoes. She disagrees that resistance is futile and is there to prove it.",

We watch the two women in particular: Satara sings with emotion and includes dance in her final performance, an action that puts her life in danger; Lema is traditional, but her very appearance brings death threats. The three finalists are from different tribes, and each makes a plea for Afghan unity. The camera visits families watching the competition, there are comments from people in the street, and we return home with a nervous Setara. In Afghanistan, singing is an expression of freedom.",

After the unanticipated incapacitation of the doctor, the Max crashes safely on the desert planet of Tatooine where the droids ironically find themselves once more at the mercy of scavenging Jawas. A precocious and curious little Jawa named Skeetie proceeds to take the droids on a wild adventure that ultimately ends with a provocative revelation.",
